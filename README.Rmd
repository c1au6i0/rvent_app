The rvent_app is a shiny application developed to import, bin and summarized session files obtained with the [SCIREQ pletysmograph](https://www.scireq.com/). Under the hood it uses functions of tje  [rvent package](https://github.com/c1au6i0/rvent).

## App

A tutorial is available within the rvent_app. 
The rvent_app is hosted here:
https://rden.shinyapps.io/rvent_app/

### Accepted files and recording

The `rvent_app` extract some of the metadata from the subject name and comments provide in the output file. Thus, it is important to follow some rules for recording sessions.

**Subject name**

*Subject name* needs to contain a numeric ID (rest of the name will be discarded) followed by a drug name. 
These are all examples of accepted formats for subject 1 receiving 3 mg/kg of milk:
```
1 milk 3 mg/kg # prefered
1_milk_3_mg/kg
1 milk
1 milk ignoredinfo
```
These are examples of not accepted formats:
```
milk 1
milk rat1
```

**Comments**

*Comments* are used to identify the injection time. 
When one or more subjects receive an injection, use the SCIREQ software to add a comment in the form ID DRUG DOSE UNIT.
For example, these are the accepted formats for a session in which subjects 1, 2 and 3 received 3 mg/kg of milk:
```
1 2 3 milk 3 mg/kg # prefered
rat 1 and 2 and 3 milk 3 mg/kg
rat1_2_3_milk 3 mg/kg
rat1 2 3 milk
```
**If dose or unit are not inserted**, the rvent_app will ask you to fill that info.

Note that subject are expected to get one injection per session.
